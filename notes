compiled

	targets
		shared libraries
		programs

	sources

not compiled

	files

targets: created from a list of sources, these are compiled

sources: files that are used to build targets, these are compiled

files: files that are not used to build anything, these are not
compiled


Global attributes: attributes that apply to all types of objects

cp_dest: copy destination of object
ln_dest: link destination of object

cflags: flags to give to the C compiler
cxxflags: flags to give to the C++ compiler
cppflags: flags to give to the preprocessor
incdirs:  -I directories


Target attributes: attributes that apply to target objects

prelibs: libraries to build before building the target
ldflags: flags to give to the linker
linkopts: -Wl, linker options
libdirs:  -L directories
libs: -l libraries
srcs: sources used to compile object


shared library attributes: attributes that apply to shared libraries

current: first component in version information
revision: second component in version info
age: third component in version info
