		programs
		object files

	sources

not compiled

	files

targets: created from a list of sources, these are compiled

sources: files that are used to build targets, these are compiled

files: files that are not used to build anything, these are not

prelibs: libraries to build before building the target
ldflags: flags to give to the linker
link_opts: -Wl, linker options
libdirs:  -L directories
libs: -l libraries
srcs: sources used to compile object
install_dirs: directories to install the target into

current: first component in version information
revision: second component in version info
age: third component in version info
